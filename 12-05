Tasks to do: 
Logit/RF model refining and code commenting [Matt]
	- created some functions, still need a bit of work but I will continue to work on this.
 	- if anyone else is interested in this part, feel free to give it a shot
Corresponding model accuracy plots [Matt/Diego]
	I have code for KL divergence Prof suggested to us
plots /visualizations [Yesh/Anita/Matt/Diego]
	I will work on some map visuals. Other plots and things are up for grabs
Data dictionary [Yesh/Anita]
dashboard/presentation [Yesh/Anita]
	Good start on this by Anita, should be easier to edit with cleaner data
upload virtualenv information [Matt]
	I will upload my virtualenv package list to the repo when we are done

Tasks Done: 
1.  Collect data cleaning steps into a single function [Diego] 
	[Matt] added two steps to the cleaning function, runs well, didn't really change the cleaned_df
 		just changed the target vars to 1,0 instead of 1,2
   		and made sure income was nonnegative (there were a few nonnegative values for some reason that threw of my stratification method

     


I still see the final Repository looking like this: 
Code (folder)
	- data merging script (hmda + census) 
	- data cleaning script
	- chart making/mapping script
	- modeling/model tuning script
 	- FINAL SCRIPT complete with functions
Raw Data (folder)
	- original MA HMDA data csv
Saved Data (folder)
	- merged hmda + census csv file
	- cleaned data csv
	cleaned data/geographical .shp file
Output (folder)
	- final model(s) script
	- data used for final models (csv) 
	- models and analysis dashboard (HTML)
